# Development and Mirror of IPB ISA-Tab DataSets

This repository contains the ISA-Tab metadata of IPB studies. 
For rendering, we are using the [ISATab-Viewer](https://github.com/ISA-tools/ISATab-Viewer) by the ISA Team at University of Oxford.

## MetaboLights
Studies on the EMBL-EBI MetaboLights repository are not publicly visible 
prior to curation by the MetaboLights team, so we mirror them here
for better visibility. After successful review, the studies are also available 
from the respective MetaboLights URL, e.g. https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metabolights/MTBLS2
