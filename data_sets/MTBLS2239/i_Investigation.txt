Study Protocol Description	<p>Samples of were collected in the field and put in sterile petri dishes at locations in Southern Sweden in September 2022 and in Germany in October 2022. After an incubation period of five days, the plant material was isolated, washed under a light microscope to remove dirt and other residues, filled into Eppendorf tubes and shock-frozen (LC-MS analyses), or dried (marker sequencing). Remaining plant material was stored as voucher specimens in the Herbarium Haussknecht Jena (barcodes: JE04010739-JE04010754).</p>	<p>We followed extraction procedures for LC-MS originally developed for vascular plants by Blatt-Janmaat 2022 and adapted for the use with bryophytes and the different analytical setup used herein. This data-dependent acquisition method has been shown to provide robust results and high-quality spectra for thallose liverworts. In detail, frozen plants were homogenized for 5 minutes at 30 Hz in Teflon chambers equipped with two stainless steel balls. The chambers were rinsed with 100 µL of cold 80:20 MeOH:H2O supplemented with 2 µM 4-Methylumbelliferon, 5µM Kinetin (Sigma), 5µM Biochanin A (Sigma), and 5 µM N-(3-Indolylacetyl)-L-alanine (Sigma) and the slurry was shook at 1000 rpm for 15 minutes at room temperature. The mixture was centrifuged twice at 13000 rpm for 15 minutes and the supernatant was transferred to autosampler vials. </p>	<p>Samples were separated with an Agilent 1290 Infinity HPLC (Agilent, Waldbronn, Germany) equipped with a Nucleodur X18 Gravity-SB column (1.8µm 100x2 Macherey Nagel, Dueren, Germany).</p>	<p>A Bruker TIMS-TOF-MS (timsTOF Pro, Bruker, Bremen, Germany) was used for mass spectrometry analyses. Separations were performed at 35°C with the following binary gradient of 0.1% aqueous formic acid (solvent A) and acetonitrile (solvent B): isocratic 98% A for 1 minute; a linear gradient from 98% to 5% A from 1 to 14 minutes; isocratic 5% A from 14 to 17.5 minutes; isocratic 98% A from 18 to 20 minutes. The flow rate was maintained at 0.5mL/min, the injection chamber was maintained at 4°C. Injections were performed separately for positive and negative ionization mode. Data-dependent acquisition (DDA-MS) mode was used with the instrument settings.</p>	<p>Raw data converted into mzML format using msconvert. Data processing was performed in the statistical software environment R version 4.1.2 using the iESTIMATE framework (https://github.com/ipb-halle/iESTIMATE). Chromatographic peak detection was performed using the R package XCMS version 3.14.0. The following settings were used for the negative ion mode: CentWaveParam, ppm = 25, mzCenterFun = “mean”, peakwidth = c(7.2, 36), prefilter = c(2, 50), mzdiff = 0.0012, snthresh = 7, noise = 0, integrate = 1, firstBase-lineCheck = TRUE, verboseColumns = FALSE, fitgauss = FALSE, roiList = list(), roiScales = numeric()). For the positive ion mode different settings were used for: peakwidth = c(9.4, 32), prefilter = c(6, 51), mzdiff = -0.0043, snthresh = 2. Grouping of chromatographic peaks was performed before and after retention time correction with the following settings in both ion modes: PeakDensityParam, minFraction = 0.7, bw = 0.25, minSamples = 1, binSize = 0.5. Retention time correction was performed with the following settings: PeakGroupsParam, minFraction = 0.7, smooth = “loess”, span = 0.2, family = “gaussian”. Only metabolite features with retention times less than 1020 s were considered for further analysis. The MS1-level peak tables were created separately for positive and negative ion modes with the settings featureValues, method = “medret”, value = “into”. The peak tables were log2-transformed, and missing values were imputed with zeros. Histograms and PCA diagnostic plots were generated to additionally evaluate the distribution of the data. MS2-level fragment spectra (MS-MS spectra) that were acquired by the Data-Dependent Acquisition mode (DDA-MS) were extracted from the profiles using the chromPeakSpectra, msLevel = 2 L, return.type = “Spectra” settings of XCMS. Spectra obtained from the same precursor ion were combined using the combineSpectra function from the R package Spectra using the following settings: FUN = combinePeaks, ppm = 25, peaks = “union”, minProp = 0.8, intensityFun = median, mzFun = median, backend = MsBackendDataFrame. This step was performed separately for positive and negative ion modes. The MS1-level peak tables were then filtered to include only peaks for which the DDA-MS had acquired MS-MS fragment spectra. The spectra were saved in MSP and MGF files for further data processing. As standard variance and median values were within 10% deviations, the filtered MS1-level peak tables containing log-transformed abundances of peaks in positive and negative ion modes were joined and used for further statistical analyses. Presence/absence peak tables were also generated to contain whether a metabolite feature was detected in the profiles. Features with abundances less than 10−8 % of the median abundance were considered absent.</p>	<p>Annotation of MS-MS fragment spectra was carried out using the software SIRIUS version 5.6.1. The settings described in Peters et al.2023 were used for both ionizations. Annotation was accomplished automatically by selecting the highest-ranking candidate for each spectrum. If the software could provide a COSMIC score, the candidate with the highest-ranking COSMIC score was selected. The corresponding SMILES and the compound classification provided by the CANOPUS were extracted and stored for each spectrum. The classification provided by CANOPUS for each MS-MS fragment spectrum was aggregated and stored in a separate classification table. Compound classes were analyzed at the ChemOnt level of subclasses and superclasses. The classes were aggregated and counted for each spectrum found in a sample and multiplied by the peak abundances of the corresponding MS1 precursors. The same procedure was accomplished for classes obtained from the Natural Product Classifier. Molecular descriptors were calculated for the SMILES provided by SIRIUS using RCDK resulting in a data matrix with SMILES in rows and descriptors in columns. A data table was constructed corresponding to the feature table by performing a matrix operation of both tables. </p>
