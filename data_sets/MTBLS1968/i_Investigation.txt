Study Title	"Local neighbourhood determines the chemical composition of leaves, roots and root exudates in four subtropical forest tree species"
Study Description	"<p>Plants produce thousands of compounds, collectively called the metabolome, which mediate interactions with other organisms. The metabolome of an individual plant may change according to the number and nature of these interactions. We tested the hypothesis that tree diversity level affects the metabolome of four subtropical tree species in a biodiversity ecosystem- functioning experiment, BEF-China. We postulated that the chemical diversity of leaves, roots and root exudates increases with tree diversity. We expected the strength of this diversity effect to differ among leaf, root and root exudates samples. Considering their role in plant competition, we expected to find the strongest effects in root exudates. </p><p>In an ecometabolomics approach, roots, root exudates and leaves of four tree species (Cinnamomum camphora, Cyclobalanopsis glauca, Daphniphyllum oldhamii, Schima superba) were sampled from selected plots in BEF-China. Samples were extracted and analysed using Liquid Chromatography-Time of Flight-Mass Spectrometry. The exudate metabolomes were normalized over their non-purgeable organic carbon level. Multivariate analyses were applied to identify the effect of both neighbouring (local) trees and plot diversity on tree metabolomes. The species and sample specific metabolites were assigned to major compound classes using the ClassyFire tool, whereas m/z features related to diversity effects were annotated manually.</p><p>Individual tree species showed distinct leaf, root and root exudate metabolomes. The main compound class in leaves were the flavonoids, whereas carboxylic acids, prenol lipids and specific alkaloids were most prominent in root exudates and roots. Overall plot diversity had a stronger effect on metabolome profiles than the diversity of local, directly neighbouring trees. Leaf metabolomes responded more often to tree diversity level than exudates, whereas root metabolomes varied the least. We found not overall correlation between metabolite richness or diversity and tree diversity.</p><p>Synthesis: Classification of metabolites supported initial ecological interpretation of differences among species and organs. Particularly the metabolomes of leaves and root exudates respond to differences in tree diversity. These responses were neither linear nor uniform and individual metabolites showed different dynamics. More controlled interaction experiments are needed to dissect the causes and consequences of the observed shifts in plant metabolomes.</p>"

Study Protocol Description	"<p>The sampling took place from 19th of October until 28th of October 2019. We took our samples in the 13 plots in the BEF China experiment that contained our target species. We sampled root exudates, roots and leaves of the above-mentioned four tree species in plots with species richness levels 1, 2, 4, 8, or 16(24) species. In monoculture plots (1 per species), we sampled three randomly selected trees. In 2- species plots, 4-8 replicates were sampled for each species. In plots with 4, 8, 16/24 species, we sampled 2-7 trees per species.</p><p><br></p><p>For the collection of root exudates, we followed the protocol of (Phillips et al., 2008), with slight modifications, see the present manuscript. In brief, the root exudates were collected from the middle of two trees under each combination. We carefully excavated the roots from the upper 10 cm of mineral soil, starting from the base of the tree.</p><p><br></p><p>To recover the root exudates, a 0.22 μm sterile filter was placed on a vacuum pump manifold over a 60 mL glass/plastic vial and the exudate solution was collected into the vial. Five ml of the exudate solution of each sample was aliquoted for Non-Purgeable Organic Carbon (NPOC) analysis (see below). Root and leaf samples were put in envelopes, oven dried for 30 min under 105 °C, and then oven dried for 24 h under 60 °C.</p>
<p>
Three mixed QCs were prepared (QC roots, QC leaves, QC exudates) and run after each 8th sample. A mix of 8 commercial standards was also run after 8 samples (MM8, (Böttcher et al., 2007)). We used the following blanks: Injection blanks (ACN); extraction blanks (empty reaction tube, for roots and leaves; for exudates; empty reaction tubes with 1ml water and 1 ml methanol), furthermore for exudates: water and collection buffer from the field campaign stored in the polypropylene cryo vials as well as empty cryo-vials, all passed through the whole shipment, freeze-drying and exudate preparation process. Roots, leaves and exudates were prepared and measured in separate batches to avoid cross- contamination. Within the tissues, all samples were randomized throughout the complete process of processing and measurement. 
</p>
<p>
In some cases, roots and exudates were collected that did not correspond to the target tree species of interest. In those cases, the species were assigned based on manual curation against the monoculture plots. The ISA sample sheet and sample names contain the correct species and must be considered the authoritative truth. In these cases the MS Assay name and mzML Filename do not match the actual species. That was the case for roots and exudates of samples 14,20,38,39,40,48,56,67.
</p>
"	"<p>Dried roots and leaves were extracted for LC-MS according to a standard protocol: Per 20 mg powdered material, 1 ml of extraction buffer (75% v/v methanol, HPLC grade, 25% v/v acetate buffer (2.3 mL acetic acid and 3.41g ammonium acetate in 1L 18MΩ water, pH set to 4.8) plus 50µl 100mM IAA-Valin as internal standard) was added and shaken with ceramic beads in a tissue homogenizer (Retch MM400, Retch GmbH, Haan, Germany) for 5 min at 30Hz. Samples were centrifuged for 15 min at RT at 15.000g. The pellet was reextracted with another 1 ml of extraction buffer per 20 mg starting material, centrifuged again and both supernatants were unified. Samples were diluted 1:5 with the extraction buffer, kept at -20°C overnight, centrifuged at 15.000 g for 10 min and transferred to HPLC vials.</p><p>Exudates were freeze-dried after shipment, redissolved in 1 ml water and the bottles washed with 1 ml methanol. The samples were transferred to a new 2 ml reaction tube, completely dried (vacuum centrifuge 27°C). Then 1 ml of water was added, dissolution was aided by vortexing, ultrasonic bath and heating to 40°C, the samples centrifuged, the remaining pellet again dissolved in another 1 ml of water, centrifuged again and both supernatants were unified. After that, the samples were concentrated, but not to complete dryness, in a vacuum centrifuge.</p>"	"<p>The LC-qToF-MS data were processed all together with Bruker Compass MetaboScape Mass Spectrometry Software, Version 5.0.0 (Build 683) (Bruker Daltonik GmbH, Bremen, Germany). Mass recalibration, peak picking, peak alignment, region complete feature extraction, and grouping of isotopes, adduct and charge states was performed with the T-ReX algorithm in Metaboscape. Settings: Peak detection: intensity threshold, 1000 counts, minimum peak length, 7 spectra, feature signal, intensity. Minimum peak length for recursive feature extraction, 5 spectra. Retention time range, 0-18 min. Mass range, 90-1600 m/z. MSMS import method, average, grouped by collision energy. Ion deconvolution: EIC correlation, 0.8, primary ion, [M+H]+, seed ions, [M+Na]+, [M+K]+, [M+NH4]+, common ions, [M+H-H2O]+. T-ReX Positive Recalibration Auto-Detect. Feature filters: Minimum number of samples: present in 3 of 302, minimum for recursive feature extraction: present in 3 of 302, group filter: present in at least 80% of at least one group (1 group = all replicates from 1 diversity level within each species and tissue). Features from Blanks were excluded when the maximum signal in samples divided by maximum signal in blanks was ≤ 3. Quality checks included stability of retention time and signal intensity, check for carry-over, check for correct species identity. With these settings two feature tables were created: One that classified the plant diversity around the target trees by the diversity of the experimental plot (“plot diversity) and one that classified it by the local neighbourhood (“local diversity”). After processing, the data set for plot diversity contained 39077 features in total, to which 22520 fragment spectra were assigned; 3883 features from blanks were removed, leaving 35194. For local diversity: total, 38105, assigned fragment spectra 22104; 3649 features from blanks were excluded, leaving 34456.</p><p>For the MetaboLights deposition, raw data was converted to mzML using Bruker compassXport version 3.0.9</p>"	"<p>First, all fragment spectra were matched in a parallel search against the following data bases: NIST17 (The NIST Mass Spectrometry Data Center, U.S. Department of Commerce, Gaithersburg, MD, USA), MoNa (https://mona.fiehnlab.ucdavis.edu/), ReSpect (Sawada et al., 2012), Riken public databases http://prime.psc.riken.jp/compms/msdial/main.html MSP), Mass Bank EU (https://massbank.eu/MassBank/Index ), GNPS (https://gnps.ucsd.edu/) and an internal data base (Döll, unpublished), using the MetaboScape Spectral Library Search function (Parameters: Filter: exact match of data base entry to precursor mass. Tolerances (narrow-wide): m/z 10-30mDa, mSigma 20-100, MS/MS score 900-800) Thereafter, we performed a manual annotation of species-specific compounds with features from literature and KNApSAcK database (see “Target tree species”) based on sum formula generation (Smart Formula algorithm, MetaboScape), in-source fragmentation patterns and spectral similarities to the mentioned databases. From these manual annotations, a small spectral library was created (197 species specific compounds). This library was matched against the whole data set with the MetaboScape Spectral Library Search function without the exact match of the precursor mass to find more species specific compounds similar to the already annotated ones. For the classification approach, the whole data set was searched against NIST17 without the exact match of the precursor mass. </p>"	"<p>Chromatographic separations were performed at 40°C on an UltiMate™ 3000 Standard Ultra-High-Performance Liquid Chromatography system (UHPLC, Thermo Scientific) equipped with an Acclaim® Rapid Separation Liquid Chromatography (RSLC) 120 column (150&nbsp;×&nbsp;2.1&nbsp;mm, particle size 2.2&nbsp;μm, ThermoFischer Scientific) using the following gradient at a flow rate of 0.4&nbsp;ml&nbsp;min−1: 0–1&nbsp;min, isocratic 95% A [water/formic acid 99.9/0.1 (v/v %)], 5% B [acetonitrile/formic acid 99.9/0.1 (v/v %)]; 1-2 min, linear from 5 to 20% B; 3–8&nbsp;min, linear from 20 to 25% B; 8–16&nbsp;min, linear from 25 to 95% B; 16-18&nbsp;min, isocratic 95% B; 18 -18.01&nbsp;min, linear from 95 to 5% B; 18.01-20&nbsp;min, isocratic 5% B. Data was recorded from 0 min to 18 min. The injection volume was 10 µl for exudates and 5 µl for roots and leaves.</p>"	"<p>Eluted compounds were detected from m/z 90 to 1600 at a spectra rate of 5 Hz, (line spectra only) using an ESI-UHR-Q-ToF-MS (maXis impact, Bruker Daltonics) in positive ion mode with data dependent collision induced dissociation (Auto-MSMS mode). The following instrument settings were applied: nebulizer on, 2.5 bar; dry gas, nitrogen, 11 L min-1, dry temperature 220°C; capillary voltage, 4500 V; end plate offset, 500 V; funnel 1 radio frequency (RF), 200 Volts peak-to-peak (Vpp); funnel 2 RF, 220 Vpp; in-source collision-induced dissociation (CID) energy, 0.0 eV; hexapole RF, 120 Vpp; quadrupole ion energy, 4 eV; quadrupole low mass, 100m/z; collision gas, nitrogen; collision energy, 10 eV; prepulse storage, 7 µs.
