Study Title	A new paradigm of biofilm regulation
Study Description	<p>For decades, researchers have explored biofilm formation, yet adherence to standard pathways has impeded breakthroughs. Our study reveals the role of methylerythritol cyclodiphosphate (MEcPP), a vital intermediate in the methylerythritol phosphate (MEP) pathway, as a biofilm regulator. Increased MEcPP levels, induced by genetic modification or oxidative stress, hinder biofilm formation. Interestingly, a genetic screen identified a mutant fimE that restores biofilm formation despite high MEcPP levels. Atomic force microscopy shows reduced fimbriae on MEcPP-enriched cells, suggesting MEcPP suppresses biofilm by affecting fimbriae production. Notably, MEcPP binds to histone-like nucleoid structuring (H-NS) protein, reducing its binding to the fimE promoter, thereby boosting fimE expression and decreasing fimbriae production. </p><p>To assess whether the genetic modifications induced notable metabolic changes, we conducted targeted metabolomic analyses focusing on central carbon and energy metabolism (CCEM) in the CRISPRi strain ispg-2d and the control (ctrl-d).</p><p>This study unveils a novel biofilm regulatory mechanism that signal metabolite MEcPP disengages H-NS from fimE transcriptional repression.</p>

Study Protocol Description	<p>Five biological repeats of ispg-2d, ctrl-d strains were cultured in LB medium supplemented with appropriate antibiotics in 37 °C incubator shaker till late-logarithmic phase (OD600nm approx.0.8). Bacteria pellets were collected and washed with deionized water by centrifugation at 4 °C, followed by freeze-drying.</p>	<p>30 mg of freeze-dried E.coli was extracted in a two phase extraction as described in [doi: 10.1105/tpc.17.00060] using 900 µL of dichloromethane/ ethanol (2:1, v/v) and 150 µL of aqueous hydrochloric acid of pH 1.4. After two rounds of extraction aqueous extracts were combined and stored at -80 °C until analysis.</p>	<p>Separation of hydrophilic metabolites was performed by ion-pairing chromatography on a Nucleoshell RP18 column (2.1 x 150 mm, particle size 2.1 µm, Macherey &amp; Nagel, GmbH, Düren, Germany) using a Waters ACQUITY UPLC System, equipped with an ACQUITY Binary Solvent Manager and ACQUITY Sample Manager (5 µL injection volume; Waters GmbH, Eschborn, Germany). Eluents A and B were aqueous 10 mmol/L tributyl amine (adjusted to pH 6.2 with glacial acetic acid) and acetonitrile, respectively. Elution was performed isocratically for 2 min with 2% eluent B, from 2 to 18 min with a linear gradient up to 36% B, and from 18-21 min up to 95% B, and isocratically from 21 min to 22.5 min with 95% B, from 22.51 to 26 min again down to 2% B. The flow rate was set to 400 µL/min, and the column temperature was maintained at 40 °C.</p>	<p>Mass spectrometric analyses of small molecules were performed by targeted MS/MS via multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) by using a QTRAP 6500 (AB Sciex GmbH, Darmstadt, Germany) operating in negative ionization mode and controlled by Analyst 1.7.1 (AB Sciex GmbH, Darmstadt, Germany). The source operation parameters were the following: ion spray voltage, -4500 V; nebulizing gas, 60 psi; source temperature, 450 °C; drying gas, 70 psi; curtain gas, 35 psi.</p>	<p>Peak integration was performed using the MultiQuant software version 3.0.3 (Sciex, Toronto, CA). Individual CCEM peak areas of n=5 biological replicates were normalized to the total peak area for each sample and averaged for the ispg-2d and the ctrl-d group, respectively. Finally, the group average of ispg-2d was divided by the average ctrl-d control samples. All area ratio data were logarithmized to the basis of 2.</p><p>The Sciex *.wiff files were converted to mzML with Proteowizard msconvert version 3.0.19142.</p>	<p>Data acquisition was performed in targeted approach based on known retention time and MS/MS multiple reaction monitoring.</p>
