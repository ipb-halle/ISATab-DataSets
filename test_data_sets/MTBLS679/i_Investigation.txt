Study Title	From Field to Feature in Ecometabolomics: LC-MS Based Metabolite Profiles of Thirteen Grassland Plant Species Reflecting Environmental Dynamics
Study Description	<p>In plants, secondary metabolites provide a unique opportunity to explore seasonal variation and responses to the environment. These include both abiotic and biotic factors. In field experiments, such stress factors occur in combination. This variation alters the plant metabolic profiles in yet uninvestigated ways.</p><p>This data set contains trait and mass spectrometry data of thirteen grassland species collected at four time points in the growing season in 2017. We collected above-ground vegetative material of seven grass and six herb species that were grown in plant communities with different levels of diversity in the Jena Experiment. For each sample, we recorded visible traits and acquired shoot metabolic profiles on a UPLC-ESI-Qq-TOF-MS. We performed the feature detection, grouping, and annotation in Galaxy-W4M and prepared the data for statistical analysis in R by applying missing data imputation, batch correction, and validity checks on the features. Together with this comprehensive data set, we also provide a detailed tutorial for the processing steps in R.</p>

Study Protocol Description	<p>Mass Spectrometry analysis were performed on an ACQUITY UPLC (Waters) coupled to ESI-micrOToF-Q-II (Bruker, USA). Aliquots (2 µL per sample) were separated at 40 °C on a HSS T3 C18 column (1.8 µm, 1.0 x 100 mm, RP, Waters) with the elution binary gradient at 0.15 mL min-1 flow rate: Solvent A (water/formic acid 99.9/0.1 (v/v))/Solvent B (acetonitrile/formic acid 99.9/0.1 (v/v)); initial: A 95%, 3 minutes linear A 82.7 %,10 minutes linear A 76 %, 17 minutes linear A 5 %, 18 minutes A 5 %, 18.1 minutes linear A 95 %, 20 m inutes A 95%. </p>	<p>We exported the vendor-specific data files (here Bruker’s “.d”) to the open data format “.mzML” using CompassXport (Bruker, version 3.0.9, http://www.bruker.com).</p><p><br></p><p>We pre-processed the raw LC-MS spectra of the analytical samples and the quality controls (blanks and QC) in the Galaxy-W4M web service (based on XCMS 3.0). The workflow included the following analytical and processing steps: peak picking, grouping and retention time correction. Furthermore, we annotated adducts and isotopes of the measured features and filtered for the region of interest (ROI) between 80 s and 840 s. The workflow is available here: https://doi.workflow4metabolomics.org/W4M00008. </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>We exported the pre-processed data as separate data tables: “MTBLS679_sampleMetadata”, “MTBLS679_variableMetadata” and “MTBLS679_dataMatrix”. We applied the following data cleaning and processing steps to prepare the data matrix for further (statistical) analysis: missing data imputation, batch correction, feature validity check, sample validity check. We provide a detailed description of the processing steps performed in R in “SciData_ProcessingTutorial_markdown.pdf”. The complete code used for data processing is available in “SciData_ProcessingTutorial_Rscript.R”. The processed data “MTBLS679_dataMatrix_processed” and “MTBLS679_sampleMetadata_processed” are also made available in the repository.</p>	<p>The frozen samples (leaves and shoots) were ground (20 mL plastic Vials, 2 steel grinding balls, 7 mm) at -75 °C for 150 seconds (5 x cycles: 30 s grinding, 30 s pausing) using the automized Labman IPB Cryogrinder Ball Mill (Labman Automation, UK). Rimax/Zircosil (1.2 - 1.7 mm) beads were added to aliquots (10 mg ± 5) of the ground frozen samples in 2 mL Extraction-Tubes. Methanol/Water-Solvent (80/20 v/v) with the three internal standards 5 mM Kinetin, 5 mM IAA-Val and 5 mM Biochanin A (extraction solvent) was added in a weight-specific five-fold surplus, while the samples were kept on liquid nitrogen. After thawing (3 minutes), the samples were extracted in a Homogenizer (Precellys® 24 Tissue Homogenizer, Bertin Technologies, USA) for 90 seconds (2 x cycles: 45 s run, 15 s pausing) at 6500 rpm. Supernatants were collected in a new 2 mL Extraction-Tube after being centrifugated at 16168 x g for 15 minutes. After a second extraction of the remaining pellet, 160 µL of the combined supernatants were added to 40 µL of Water/Formic acid (99.9/0.1 v/v) and stored at -20 °C for at least 48 hours. Supernatants were again centrifugated at 16168 x g for 15 minutes and transferred to HPLC-Vials (Glasinlet, 300µl) to be measured in a UPLC-MS-QToF-System.</p><p>An aliquot (10 µL) of each extracted sample was combined as a quality control sample (QC) to keep track of possible irregularities with extraction and the mass spectrometric analyses.</p>	<p>Features were measured in positive ion mode from 100 to 1000 m/z using internal calibration (lithium formate clusters, 10 mM lithium hydroxide in isopropanol/water/formic acid, 49.9/ 49.9/0.2 (v/v/v), at 18 min) and following instrument settings: capillary voltage 5000 V; nebulizer gas nitrogen; nebulizer 1.4 bar; dry gas nitrogen; dry gas temperature 190 °C; dry gas flow 6 L min-1; spectra rate 3 Hz; endplate offset: -500 V; Funnel 1 RF: 200 Vpp; Funnel 2 RF: 200 Vpp; in-source CID energy 0 eV; hexapole RF 100 Vpp; quadrupole ion energy 3 eV; collision gas nitrogen; collision energy 7 eV; collision RF 200/400 Vpp (timing 50/50); transfer time 50 to 70 µs; pre pulse storage 5 µs.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p>	No identification of metabolite structures was performed.	<p>Aboveground vegetative plant material was collected in plots of the Trait-Based Experiment (TBE) in the Jena Experiment, Germany. Plant individuals were selected from plots with the designed diversity levels of 1, 2, 4 or 8 species by taking possible functional group mixtures grass-grass' (GG), 'grass-herb' (GH) and 'herb-herb' (HH) into account. Biomass of two specimens (biological replicates) at a similar phenological stage (classified with BBCH scale by Hess et al. 1997), was sampled, by cutting 3 cm above ground, and snap freezing the sample on dry ice.</p><p>Sampling was conducted in spring, summer (early and late) and autumn covering the growing season (May to October) in 2017. Damage levels for each plant, including mechanical (e.g. herbivory) and pathogen-induced damage were recorded for each sample. The exact day time of sampling was recorded to account for diurnal chemical shifts within the plant individuals.</p>
